I have been running my own Kubernetes clusters, developing automation, developing software, and generally experimenting with technology for some time. Usually I find that others have blogged about the topics that I am interested in, and have rarely found a desire to duplicate those efforts in the past.  

Lately, however, I have found myself implementing solutions that aren't well covered by others.  Or, I have a topic that I want to write about more personally.  And so this blog was born.

I doubt that anyone will ever find or discover this content.  But, if you do, then please feel free to [start a discussion][github-discussions] with me!
