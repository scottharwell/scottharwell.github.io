This is a simple blog for me to write ideas and experiences publicly.  I intend to cover mostly technical topics to share what I learn as I develop automation, applications, or other personal tools.  All of the ideas, commentary, and dialog on this site are my own.

You can find me at the following places on the web:

* GitHub at [scottharwell][github]{:target="_blank"}
* [Ansible Content Lab for Cloud Automation][content-lab]{:target="_blank"}
* LinkedIn at [scottharwell][linkedin]{:target="_blank"}
* StackOverflow at [scott-harwell][stack-overflow]{:target="_blank"} -- though less active these days

And, formerly of some other communities around the web that I don't directly participate in any longer.
